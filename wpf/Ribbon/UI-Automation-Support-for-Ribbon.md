# UI Automation Support for Ribbon

Automated tests that drive your application through its user interface (UI) are known as coded UI tests (CUITs). These tests include functional testing of the UI controls. They let you verify that the whole application, including its user interface, is functioning correctly. 

Now the ribbon and its sub controls like RibbonButton, RibbonTab, and RibbonBar can be identified in coded UI test recording. AutomationPeer classes for ribbon-related controls are included in the assembly. This helps in the UI automation process with ribbon controls.
