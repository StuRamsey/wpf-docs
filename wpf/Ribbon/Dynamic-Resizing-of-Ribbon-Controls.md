# Dynamic Resizing of Ribbon Controls

Ribbon Control provides Office 2007 UI. While resizing the ribbon window, which contains the Ribbon Controls, the ribbon controls automatically resize to fit into the Ribbon layout panel. Note: Further resizing the ribbon window will collapse the ribbon bars containing the ribbon controls.

Following property is used to activate the dynamic resizing feature of ribbon controls.

IsAutoSizeFormEnabled â€“ Gets or sets a value indicating whether the ribbon controls should dynamically resize to its auto size form or not. This is a dependency property.

## Enabling Dynamic Resizing of Rabin control

Set IsAutoSizeFormEnabled to true to enable Dynamic Resizing of Rabin control.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
[XAML]   <syncfusion:Ribbon Name="MyRibbon" IsAutoSizeFormEnabled="True"></syncfusion:Ribbon></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>

</table>
