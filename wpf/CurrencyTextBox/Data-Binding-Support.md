# Data Binding Support

Data binding is the process of establishing a connection between the application UI and business logic. Data binding can be unidirectional (source -> target or target <- source) or bidirectional (source <-> target). You can bind the data to the CurrencyTextBox through the Value property.

The following example shows a simple binding between the value of the CurrencyTextBox and another CurrencyTextBox value that reflects the typed value:



{% highlight xml %}





<StackPanel>

    <syncfusion:CurrencyTextBox x:Name="currencyTextBox1" Width="150" Margin="10"/>

    <syncfusion:CurrencyTextBox x:Name="currencyTextBox2" Width="150" Margin="10" 

            Value="{Binding ElementName=currencyTextBox1,Path=Value,Mode=TwoWay}"/>

</StackPanel>
{% endhighlight %}

The Data Context property provides its value to child elements. So you can set the Data Context on a superior layout container and its value is provided to all child elements. This is very useful if you want to build a form that is bound to multiple properties of the same data object. If you don't explicitly define a source of binding, it takes the data context by default.


{% highlight xml %}






<StackPanel DataContext="{StaticResource myCustomer}">

    <TextBox Text="{Binding FirstName}"/>

    <TextBox Text ="{Binding LastName}"/>

    <syncfusion:CurrencyTextBox Value="{Binding Phone}"/>

    <syncfusion:CurrencyTextBox Value="{Binding Income}"/>

</StackPanel>
{% endhighlight %}


If you want to bind values other than decimal values, then you need to use the Value Converter. The following example shows a simple binding between the value of the CurrencyTextBox and the Textbox text that reflects the typed value:


{% highlight xml %}





<StackPanel>

    <StackPanel.Resources>

        <c:StringToDecimalConverter x:Key="stringToDecimalConverter"/>

    </StackPanel.Resources>



<syncfusion:CurrencyTextBox x:Name="currencyTextBox" Width="150" Margin="10"/>

<TextBox x:Name="textBox" Width="150" Margin="10" Text="{Binding 

        ElementName=currencyTextBox,Path=Value,Mode=TwoWay,Converter={StaticResource 

        stringToDecimalConverter}}"/>

</StackPanel>

{% endhighlight %}
