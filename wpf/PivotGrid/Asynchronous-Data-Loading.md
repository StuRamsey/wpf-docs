## Asynchronous Data Loading

The PivotGrid control provides support for loading data in a unique UI thread. That is, the PivotGrid control can perform long running operations asynchronously on a background thread so that users can access other UI controls while the grid is loading. It also loads asynchronously for every layout change operation, such as filtering, sorting, drag and drop, manipulating the field list, or changing the Pivot Schema Designer. This can be achieved by setting the LoadInBackground property to true.

#### To enable asynchronous loading

{% highlight C# %}   


         // Loading asynchronously on a background thread.



          this.pivotGrid1.InternalGrid.LoadInBackground = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight vbnet %}
