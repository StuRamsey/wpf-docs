## Multi-column Sorting

Multi-column sorting behavior is implemented in PivotGrid at normal mode that allows you to sort the grid by one field after the other.

### Use Case Scenario

There are three different fields being rendered by the PivotGrid and it can be sorted in any desired manner. For example: OrderBy(Country), OrderBy(State), OrderBy(City). 

### Applying multi-column sorting in PivotGrid Control

Refer the following screenshots that display the step-by-step implementation of multi-column sorting.
