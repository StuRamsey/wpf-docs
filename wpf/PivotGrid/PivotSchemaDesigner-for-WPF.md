# PivotSchemaDesigner for WPF

**PivotSchemaDesigner** can be supported in PivotGrid, so that it can be presented like an **ExcelPivotTable**. It enables drag and drop feature of fields between different areas like Column, row, value and filter. By using the PivotSchemaDesigner, you can add, rearrange, or remove fields to show data in a PivotGrid exactly the way that you want. It contains two sections, consisting of the following items:

* A **field section** at the top for adding fields to and removing fields from the PivotGrid.
* A **layout section** at the bottom for rearranging and repositioning the fields in the PivotGrid.
