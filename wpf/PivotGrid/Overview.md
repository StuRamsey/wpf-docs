# Overview

The pivot grid is a powerful cell-oriented, extensible grid control which works with relational data. It simulates the pivot table feature of Microsoft Excel. The pivot grid pivots, summarizes, and groups data to organize it in a cross-tabulated form. It is used in financial domains to organize and analyze the business data.
