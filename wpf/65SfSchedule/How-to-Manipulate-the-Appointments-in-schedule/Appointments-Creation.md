#### Appointments Creation

Initially, we have seen how the appointments are rendered by binding the remote data. In order to add the appointments through UI to the schedule control, we need to double click on the appropriate schedule cells, in prior to the required time and then need to provide the required details on the appointment Editor that pops up. There is also an another option available in Context Menu to quickly add the appointments to the schedule control, by clicking the Add Option in Context Menu on required schedule cells. While adding new appointments to the schedule control either by making use of local or remote data, the new appointment data is saved automatically to the appointment collection.

The below image shows the appointment Editor that pops up while Clicking the Add option available in Context Menu.
