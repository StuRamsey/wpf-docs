# Text

You can annotate the image by adding the desired text on it. This can be done in the following two ways.

1.	Using in-built toolbar
2.	Programmatically using code.


## Toolbar

To add text, click on the Text icon (T) in the toolbar. Now the text will be added at the center of the image along with the selection handle which helps in resizing. By default, added text will be in pan mode hence you can position the text anywhere by clicking and dragging on the it. By clicking again on the text, it will change into typing mode and you can edit the text directly. Click outside to exit from typing mode.

## Customization

The following properties of the added text can be customized.

* Font family
* Font size
* Font color
* Alignment (Center, Left, Right)
* Text Effects (Bold, Italic, Underline)

Upon selecting the Text icon in the toolbar, a sub toolbar will be generated below the main toolbar for providing the text customizing options. 

>N Text needs to be selected to apply the customization from the sub toolbar.

### Font family

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
