# ToolBarAdv with Overflow items

When ToolBarAdv control contains more items, it cannot be displayed within the toolbar's size. So they are listed in the Overflow popup. You can click the Overflow button to view these items. 

ToolBarAdv enables you to set the overflow mode for each item. 

* OverflowMode.Always â€“ Specified item will always be listed in the Overflow popup.
* OverflowMode.Never - Specified item will never be moved to the Overflow popup.
* OverflowMode.AsNeeded - Specified item will be listed in the Overflow popup if required.
