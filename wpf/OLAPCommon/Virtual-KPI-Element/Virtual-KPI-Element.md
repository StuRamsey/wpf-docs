# Virtual KPI Element

Key performance indicators can be virtually defined during run time. This feature enables users to create KPIs without storing them in SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services). This feature is very useful when users want to define KPIs at run time and also minimize the time necessary to create KPIs.
