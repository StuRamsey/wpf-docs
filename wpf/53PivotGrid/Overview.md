# Overview

Essential PivotGrid for WPF is a powerful cell-oriented, extensible grid control. It simulates the pivot table feature of Excel. The PivotGrid, as the name implies, pivots data through a drag-and-drop operation using PivotSchemaDesigner (source shipped as PivotTools.Wpf with PivotGrid samples), to organize the data in a cross-tabulated form. The major advantage with a pivot grid is that you can extract the desired information from a large list within seconds. Along with presenting the data, a pivot grid also enables you to summarize and group data. It finds its main application in the financial domain, where it is used to organize and analyze business data.
