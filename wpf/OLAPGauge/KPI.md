# KPI

OlapGauge provides support to display Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the OLAP Cube. KPI Value is represented with the help of _Pointers_ and KPI Goal is represented with the help of _Markers_. The KPI Status and KPI Trend values are represented through user friendly images like Traffic Light, Road Signs and Standard Arrow in OlapGauge WPF. Each Gauge represents a member against one KPI combination.
