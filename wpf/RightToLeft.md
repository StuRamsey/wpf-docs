# Right-to-Left

Right-to-Left(RTL) support displays the content from right-to-left direction by setting the [FlowDirection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.flowdirection) property to `RightToLeft`. This is helpful to support the Right-to-Left scripted languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, etc., 

All WPF Syncfusion controls supports Right-to-Left (RTL) based on FlowDirection property. In addition to that, all controls provides [localization](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/localization) support to change language of strings used in control specific to any culture.
