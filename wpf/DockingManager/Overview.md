# Overview

The DockingManager control implements an architecture that allows child controls to be docked to any part of a window as in Microsoft Visual Studio. You can add the DockingManager control as a child to your windows and add the child elements to this control to dock them. The dock panels containing the child elements can be interactively dragged to any area within the window, with the advanced support of effective visual cues. These windows can also be floated, tabbed, and auto hidden at run time.
