# Appearance

## Blendability

The PropertyGrid control can easily be editable in blend. You can edit the template of the PropertyGrid control to give a good look and feel for the control using Expression Blend.

### Using blendability support in an application

Create the PropertyGrid control using Blend. After creating the PropertyGrid control using Blend, select it and go to “Object” -> “Edit Style” -> “Edit a Copy” to edit the Template of the PropertyGrid control.

This will open a dialog (below) where you can give a name of your own style and define exactly where you would like to store it.

What’s produced through the set of steps is quite a bit of XAML which is placed within your application. This XAML represents the default style for the PropertyGrid control.
