# Grouping and Sorting

PropertyGrid groups the properties based on Category Attribute of the property and you can also sort the properties in both ascending and descending order. Sorting will be done based on the SortDirection property of the PropertyGrid control.

Using Grouping and Sorting in an Application

You can change the Sorting order by setting the SortDirection property. 

When you click the SortButton in PropertyGrid, the properties in PropertyGrid will be sorted automatically based on the SortDirection property. 

When you click the GroupButton, then the properties will be displayed by grouping based on the Category Attribute of the property.
