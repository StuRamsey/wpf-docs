# Expand Nested Properties in PropertyGrid

The PropertyGrid control has support to expand instance properties of a class which has ExpandableObjectConverter as its TypeConverter.

##  Use Case Scenarios

Using the PropertyExpandMode property, users can choose whether the nested properties of the selected object can be expanded or not. By setting the PropertyExpandMode as NestedMode, the nested properties of the selected object can be expanded, and by setting the PropertyExpandMode as FlatMode, the selected object is shown in flat mode.
