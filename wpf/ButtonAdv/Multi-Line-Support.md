# Multi Line Support

The label displayed on the button can be a line or two, when the property IsMultiLine is set to true. The default value is true.

Multiline support can be enabled by using the following code:
{% highlight html %}


<sync:ButtonAdv SizeMode="Large" IsMultiLine="False"/>

{% endhighlight %}
