# Overview

Essential Gantt for WPF is a MS Project-like Project Viewer with inbuilt grid, schedule and resource assignment constraints. It is designed to assist project managers in developing plans, assigning resources to the task, tracking task progress and so on. Some of the key features of Gantt control are: drag support for increasing and decreasing the Start and Finish Date of the Task , Drag and Drop support for  the task within a row and automatic data synchronization between Grid and Chart. This also supports to import and export the Task Details as XML file.
