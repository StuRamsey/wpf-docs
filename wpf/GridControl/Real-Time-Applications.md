# Real Time Applications

Grids can be adopted in many real time applications where the database is of crucial importance. As such applications are widely spread; the grids are indispensably used world-wide.  This section elaborates on some of the real time applications which can use Essential Grid.

## Applications with High Frequency Updates 

Grid can be used in applications with frequent updates, for example stock values in share market. When grid is switched over to virtual mode, it reforms itself as a light weight control that consumes a very little memory and processing power, and provides a very small latency under heavy load. Such virtual grids are typically useful when there is a need to display enormous data very quickly.  

### Sample

A sample which demonstrates such an application is available in the following sample installation location:
