# Adornments in WPF Charts (SfChart)

Chart adornments are used to display values related to a chart segment element. Values from data point(x, y) or other custom properties from a data source can be displayed. 

Each adornment can be represented by the following:

* Label - Displays the segment label content at the (X, Y) point.
* Marker- Displays the desired symbol at the (X, Y) point.
* ConnectorLine - Line used to connect the (X, Y) point and the label element.
