# Keyboard and Mouse support

Up or down arrows in the DoubleTextBox spin values one step up or down. Mouse Scroll in the DoubleTextBox spin the values one step up or down. The spin behavior in the DoubleTextBox can be enabled by setting the [IsScrollingOnCircle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/wpf/Syncfusion.Shared.Wpf~Syncfusion.Windows.Shared.EditorBase~IsScrollingOnCircle.html) property to true.
